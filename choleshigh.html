        Result: Very High Cholestrol Level
      </h3>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Risk Factors</h2>
        

        <p>Gender: After menopause, a woman's LDL cholesterol level ("bad" cholesterol) goes up, as does her risk for heart disease.</p>
        
        <p>Age: Your risk may increase as you get older. Men aged 45 years or older and women aged 55 years or older are at increased risk of high cholesterol and heart disease.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Family history: Your risk of high cholesterol may increase if a father or brother was affected by early heart disease (before age 55) or a mother or sister was affected by early heart disease (before age 65).</p>
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>Controllable Risk Factors for High Cholesterol Include:</h2>
        <p>Diet: The trans fats, saturated fat, sugar, and (to a lesser extent) cholesterol in the food you eat raise total and LDL cholesterol levels.</p><p>
          Weight: Being overweight can make your LDL cholesterol level go up and your HDL level go down.</p><p>
Physical activity/exercise: Increased physical activity helps to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol (the "good" cholesterol) levels. It also helps you lose weight.</p>
        <h3>Remedies for high cholesterol</h3>
        <p>If you have been determined to high cholesterol, you will typically be encouraged to make changes to your eating regimen and increment your level of physical activity. It means you have to do some sort of physical activities like running, yoga or work out.</p><p>
In the event that following a couple of months, your high cholesterol level hasn’t dropped or it is seriously high at your underlying blood test, you might be encouraged to take a cholesterol-lowering prescription, for example, statins.</p><p>
There are a lot of things you can do to help bring down your high cholesterol or to help avert high cholesterol creating, including changing your eating regimen, eliminating liquor, stop smoking and doing the regular activity.</p>
        
        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>Follow a solid eating routine:
Have healthy proteins for breakfast and the correct fats, (for example, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats), found in sustenances, for example, salmon, avocado, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.</p><p>
Avoid taking sugar: 
Decrease the measure of sugar intake in your eating routine, and control your intake of meals packed of saturated fats and trans fats.</p><p>
Sidestep processed foods:
Swap processed foods for omega-3-rich fish, for example, salmon, sardines, herring, mackerel, and trout something like two times every week. Sleek fish contains enormous measures of omega-3fats, decreasing frustation, which protect us against regular maladies, for example, coronary illness and joint pain.</p><p>
Manage your weight:
In case you’re overweight, find a way to shed pounds to decrease your danger of creating coronary illness. Losing excess weight is helpful for a wide range of reasons, from improving your cholesterol profile to counteracting type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart assaults, strokes, and malignant growth.</p>
